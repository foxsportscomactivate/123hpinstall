Why You Need Printer Drivers
*****************************

Printer drivers act as a bridge between your computer and the printer. Without the right driver:

- Your printer may not function properly.
- Features such as duplex printing or scanning might be unavailable.
- Printing speed and quality could be affected.

Regularly updating or reinstalling drivers can resolve issues like:
- Printer not responding
- Print jobs stuck in the queue
- Poor print quality or errors
